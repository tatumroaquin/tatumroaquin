Hi 👋 My name is Tatum Roaquin
==============================

I experiment with Type 1 Hypervisors such as Proxmox to build virtualised servers as a hobby. I enjoy interfacing with different types of multipurpose technologies. Allowing me to channel my curiosity through versatile usecases, and discover new interests.

* 🌍  I'm based in Sydney
* 🧠  I'm currently learning Blockchains
